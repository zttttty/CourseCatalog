This is the coursework of PA Rails1.

github repository: https://github.com/zttttty/CourseCatalog
heroku link: https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/secret-thicket-62332

start the app with the link: 0.0.0.0:3000/course_list

ps: I tried to use bootstrap by gem in the project, but I still failed after trying the
official deployment method on the bootstrap website. Finally, I add the css link
to each view page.
